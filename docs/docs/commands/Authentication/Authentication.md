To use the commands listed below, you must first authenticate using the `ghc login` command by providing a GitHub **Personal Access Token (PAT)**. Here‚Äôs how to generate and use a PAT:

#### Step 1: Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Log in to your GitHub account and go to [**Settings**](https://github.com/settings/).
2. In the sidebar, click on [**Developer settings**](https://github.com/settings/apps).
3. Click on **Personal access tokens** and then select [**Tokens (classic)**](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
4. Click the **Generate new token** button.
5. Give your token a descriptive name and select the necessary scopes for your CLI tool (such as `repo`, `read:org`, and `user`).
6. Scroll down and click **Generate token**.
7. Copy the generated token.

:::warning

**Important:** Avoid selecting unnecessary scopes to prevent unauthorized access to your GitHub account.

**Note:** You can always revoke a token if you suspect it has been compromised.

#### Step 2: Authenticate with the Personal Access Token

Once you have your token, run the following command to authenticate with `ghc`:

### For logging in

```bash
ghc login
```

The CLI will prompt you to enter your PAT. Paste the token you generated in Step 1.

**Note:** While pasting the token on the terminal, right-click on the terminal.

Once authenticated, you will be able to access all the commands that require login.
