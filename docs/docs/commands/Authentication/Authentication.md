To use the commands listed below, you must first authenticate using the `ghc login` command by providing a GitHub **Personal Access Token (PAT)**. Here‚Äôs how to generate and use a PAT:

#### Step 1: Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Log in to your GitHub account and go to [**Settings**](https://github.com/settings/).
2. In the sidebar, click on [**Developer settings**](https://github.com/settings/apps).
3. Click on **Personal access tokens** and then select [**Tokens (classic)**](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
4. Click the **Generate new token** button.
5. Give your token a descriptive name and select the necessary scopes for your CLI tool (such as `repo`, `read:org`, and `user`).
6. Scroll down and click **Generate token**.
7. Copy the generated token.

:::warning

While generating a token, ensure that you only select the necessary scopes required for the commands you intend to use. Avoid selecting unnecessary scopes to prevent unauthorized access to your GitHub account.

:::

:::tip

You can always revoke a token if you suspect it has been compromised.

:::

#### Step 2: Authenticate with the Personal Access Token

Once you have your token, run the following command to authenticate with `ghc`:

```bash
ghc login
```

The CLI will prompt you to enter your PAT. Paste the token you generated in Step 1.

Once authenticated, you will be able to access all the commands that require login.
